# jjkenergymonitor
jjkEnergyMonitor is my nodejs program to update my website running emoncms.  Emoncms collects data and visualizes metrics.  

This script monitors a KAUF Energy Monitoring Smart Plug to get volts, amps, and watts being generated from grid-tie inverters plugged into solar planels. The script forms the data into a URL and sends it to the emoncms website for visualization on my website
